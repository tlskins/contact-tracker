## Contact Tracker Mobile App
Serverless contact tracking mobile app for store owners.

# Mobile App
Iphone and Android compatible mobile app written using expo, react-native, and typescript. Expo is a framework and platform for creating and distributing react native applications. To test an Expo app the user will want to decide what host(s) and client(s) you will want to use which can allow you to test different distributions on different mobile devices.

# App Host
After cloning this project a user can run their own Expo server via Expo CLI or you can test a staging distrubtion of this project via the url below. Running your own Expo server will allow you to test changes you make to the codebase as well as let you test the app on emulators you have installed on your computer. The staging distribution will be a stable distribution of this project that is publicly available. The staging distribution's backend api host will be pointing to serverless host that I will maintain for a limited period of time.

Staging URL

# Client
The client can be tested via an Iphone or Android mobile device or an emulator. To test on your mobile device you will need to download the app Expo client. If you are testing the staging distribution, clicking the link for the distribution app host will invite you to test the app in Expo client.
